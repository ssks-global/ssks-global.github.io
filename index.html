    <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Bharat is a beautiful country where people are multi-cultural, multi lingual, multi ethnic and multi community yet are living as a single society since thousands of years back. As part of the evolution, slowly most of the customs and traditions have changed among communities. In recent times, due to the globalization, these changes are taking place with a rapid speed and hence people in the society are getting access to the various opportunities to prosper from every corner of the globe. Such opportunities no doubt helped most of the people to achieve their ambitions and to reach a satisfactory position in their life.</p>
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">As people started moving across the globe, those who use to live together with same cultural practices are now scattered and as the generation changes, due to the inaccessibility to our traditional practices, unavailability of literatures and shortage of priests to educate them people are slowly leaning towards adopting the foreign culture. Such changes are less effecting in the communities where their population is large. But, many other communities having less people are already wiped out from the universe during course of time and people now have completely transformed to the other practices.</p>
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, various studies on these changes have raised concerns on this issue and started creating averseness and educating people to know the importance and history of their culture. Few people have gone further and started creating literatures and preserving it in libraries and Internet so that, next generations have access to practice and take is forward. Thanks to the Internet world to provide various means which gives guarantee that it can be maintained in the public doing for easily accessible. Some prominent enthusiast had gone outright to even dig into the past, find out the literature, talk to various people living across the globe, did thought provoking analysis on their findings and educating their community people to re attain their cultural identity.</p>
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">"Somawamsya Sahasrarjuna Kshatriya Samaj" is also one such ancient but still prospering community with its people here still following most of its traditional practices and delegating the same to their next generations as well. Majority of them are still following the "samaj" tradition for welfare of the people living in their locations. Though it follows "samaj" tradition, in this 21st century, it is highly required and need of the hour to build some means of connectivity among all the "samaj"'s at various locations, among the people in that samaj and lay down some initiations for the collective and faster growth of this community across the globe. Furthermore, Identify the people who are not yet aligned to their nearby samaj and bring them also in to the mainstream groups.</p>
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">SSK Samaj Global Portal is one such platform emerged from this very idea of establishing the connectivity among the people and samaj, provide accessibility to the history and literature and become point of source for the information required to anyone from anywhere across the globe. Furthermore, to improve the life of this community by adding more people who are living in remote locations and yet to be joined.</p>
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Last but not the least, I would request each and every one of our community people to kindly register yourself and encourage your family members and others to also join here, read through the literature, contribute to the community in various forms by sharing your knowledge and time on it with your posts and help others to get educated.</p>
